## Topic: Life Expectancy and Happiness Around The World

## Why We Chose This Topic:

After much deliberation and consideration of various datasets, sources, and general topics, we’ve decided to explore Life Expectancy, Happiness Scores, and how these two data points relate to each other on an international scale. As a team, we’ve been drawn mainly to datasets relating to geography and geopolitics, as such topics are ripe for interesting visualizations and offer broad insights into international trends. We’ve ultimately decided to explore Life Expectancy and Happiness as our topic because these datasets are relatively manageable and direct while still offering wide potential for feature analysis, visualizations, and unique insights.
